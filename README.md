# ComponentLibrary

An improved vector graphics library for illustrations of optics experiments.

ComponentLibrary is a free, open collection of images for drawing diagrams related to laser optics, including many optics but also electronic components. The images are provided as vector graphics, as Scalable Vector Graphics (svg), to be used with free tools such as Inkscape.
